This project implements a diabetes type 1 simulator based on the Hovorka model. The simulator is designed to test different control strategies for insulin delivery in type 1 diabetes patients.

The project is versioned on GitHub at **[github.com/federicomarra/dtu-diabetes1-simulation](https://github.com/federicomarra/dtu-diabetes1-simulation)**

The project is hosted on Vercel at **[dtu-diabetes1-simulation.vercel.app](https://dtu-diabetes1-simulation.vercel.app/)**

## Project Structure

The simulator is organized into the following components:

- `app/page.tsx`: Main page component that provides the user interface and visualization of the simulation
- `app/HovorkaModel.tsx`: Implementation of the Hovorka model ordinary differential equations
- `app/Simulator.ts`: Main simulator implementation that handles the simulation loop and integrates all components
- `app/Controller.ts`: Different control strategies (P, PD, PI, PID controllers)
- `app/SolverRK4.ts`: 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical solver
- `app/types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions used throughout the project

## Technical Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have `Node.js` installed on your system. You can download it
from **[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)**.

This project has been developed with version `15.2.0`, but any newer should still work.

## Local Setup

To run the project locally on your computer:

1. **Clone the repository from GitHub**
   1. Clone via terminal with the commands:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/federicomarra/dtu-diabetes1-simulation.git
      cd dtu-diabetes1-simulation
      ```
   1. Or [download the project here](https://github.com/federicomarra/dtu-diabetes1-simulation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it and open the terminal in the folder.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
